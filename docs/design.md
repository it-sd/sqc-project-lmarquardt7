## Usability Heuristics

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
  - Modification 1: Simplify my aesthetic choices and modify my color scheme to reflect a more minimalist design
     
  
#### 2. Match between System and Real World
  - Modification 2: Change some of my wording, or jargon, to be more familiar and user friendly

### Details

#### Modification 1:

  When it came to making aesthetic choices about the design of my website, I went with themes and colors that I personally like. I picked what colors I thought were cool for my favicon, the colors of my backgrounds, and even the colors of my text. At first, I thought everything was looking pretty good. Bright flashy colors to try to capture a fun and whimsical feeling. But upon inspection, I feel that I am not currently sticking to a very minimalistic design, and in fact, in some regards, things seem a bit too busy. For instance, I noticed that throughout my design I have used a handful of different shades of blue, and it appears to be too much. My favicon is a light aqua color, the background of my text box is a darker blue, and my links to movie information pages are a different blue color yet. Not only is this too much, but it actually takes away from the visibility and usability of the website, making things seem too cluttered or even hard to read and/or focus. Therefore, I plan to go back and take things in a more minimalistic approach. I still want to invoke the bright, whimsical colors associated with a trip to a movie theater, but I still want my sight to be aesthetically pleasing to look at.


#### Modification 2:

  As I was reviewing my website, I realized that in some of my headers, titles, and even in some of the descriptions that I chose to use, I was using some technical jargon based in information for technology, therefore I was not doing a good job of creating a match between the system and the real world. For instance, the header I chose to use for my page that would display a list of all the movies that I offered was headed as "Index of Movies". Now, this might not seem like too big of a deal, and for the most part, most people would probably realize that an index is simply an ordered list, but when I think about it, I realize that this might not be the typical language you would expect to see or hear at a movie theater. After all, that is what I am trying to simulate with my website. I want it to come across as a fun and easy way to find movies to watch. The last thing I want users to think about is the fact that they are actually interacting with a piece of technology. I want them to feel like they are actually deciding on what movie to see, standing in the lobby of a movie theater. Therefore, while 'Index' was just one example, I plan to go through my website design and change any words or phrasing that may seem like Tech jargon and change them to words and phrases that seem more user friendly and that invoke the spirit in which I intended for my website to be taken.

##### Too Many Blues = Not Minimalistic and Bad Visibility

## Color Scheme

  This week's module, Module 6, discussed the importance of color schemes when it comes to creating a website. For the most part, I feel I tried to stick to the 60/30/10 rule that was discussed in the article ['Using Color to Enhance Your Design'](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/color-enhance-design/) by Kelley Gordon at NN/g. This rule says that our dominant color should take up about 60% of our page, a secondary color should take up 30%, and 10% should be an accent color. If you look at my pages, pictured above, you will see that the primary color, a darkish red (138,0,0), does in fact take up the majority of the screen. The color appears in the form of a movie theater curtain, which after all is my underlying theme for the entire website. I wanted to choose colors, and fonts for that matter, that reflect the emotions of actually going to a movie theater. In which, the general appearance is rather dark, with a few splashes of color, with red being my splash of color. Other than this red I utilize a series of darker colors to invoke the dark atmosphere, using a navy blue (19, 2, 75) as my secondary color, and both white and black acting as accent colors. Together, this color combination could be best described as similar to a triad color scheme or even a split complementary with a few colors missing, but in reality, it is actually a custom color scheme that I feel plays well together and captures the feel I aim to achieve.
