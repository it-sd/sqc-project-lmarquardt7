    <p>
          It seems like in todays world, whenever you decide you want to see a specific movie, it turns out that you are paying for the wrong streaming service, the streaming service that does not have the movie you want. On the flip side, if you just want to try something new and start browsing for a movie to watch on your streaming service, you spend hours and cannot find anything that seems interesting. Therefore, I want to create a website that allows you to either find your favorite movies or explore new movies, learn a bit about them, and then find a streaming service in which you could immediately watch which ever movie you wanted. Using the Open Movie Database, users can search or browse through a large database of movies, they can see IMDb information, movie title, year of movie, plot of movie, and much more. Then using the data provided by Watchmode, users can tell which streaming platform they can currently watch that movie on. All in all, this website can take a lot of the guess and check, and the disappointment out of sitting through a bad movie, out of your next movie or date night
